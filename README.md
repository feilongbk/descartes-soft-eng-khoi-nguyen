# Descartes Underwriting

This repository contains material about the software engineer recruitment test. 


All instructions can be found in the notebook [earthquake-risk-greece.ipynb](https://github.com/descartes-underwriting/software-engineer-technical-test/blob/main/notebook/earthquake-risk-greece.ipynb)


## Submission

The solution to this test (the source code, the test code and the notebook with its outputs) should be saved on a private `descartes-soft-eng` repository on your github account.

Access should be granted to all members of the [descartes-underwriting group](https://github.com/orgs/descartes-underwriting/people).

## NOTE
I have written a small application, inspired by the test, to make the creation and analysis of policies easier.
You can find access the application at [http://[35.198.191.123](http://34.76.197.173/):2022/](http://34.76.197.173:2022/) with following credentials:
