## Disclaimer
This project is a part of the recruitment process for a position at Descartes Underwriting.
It is realized by the candidate (Khoi Nguyen NGUYEN).
Solutions and ideas presented in the project are not mean to be used for a production environment without careful study, adaptation and testing. The candidate refused all responsibility related to eventual losses and due to usage of these solutions for professional purpose.

## Introduction
The test can be decomposed into different parts that represent the process of pricing an insurance policy:
A. Data Collecting: Get earthquake data from the USGS API
B. Financial Modelling: Model an earthquake index-based policy and compute several statistics
C. Performance Optimization: Collecting large amount of earthquake data using async requests as a strategy to speed-up 

The solution consists of 3 parts:
1. Fulfill the objectives of the test
2. Study of the context and propose another strategy that could improve the solution presented in 1, from software engineering and system architecture point of view.
3. Demonstration of the proposed strategy by a PoC
